# Theta-Fuel OfflineWallet

### General
This is my first blockchain programming for Theta Hackathon V3.

### Description
This wallet allows you to sign and send transactions into the Theta Network, while your private key remains offline.
The wallet has two parts, one is online and the other is offline.
Inside the online part you define a transaction, while the offline version does the transaction signing with the private key.
Quick information exchange between online- and offline- device is done by QR-Codes or file exchange, e.g. SD-Card.

### How to run - Quick Guide
Two devices are needed, e.g. two older mobile phones with QR-Code scanning capabilities.
To open the wallet, just open the corresponding HTML file with a browser.
Depending on browser and browser security configuration, some functions may or may not work as expected.

#####  Online:  
Setup your transaction with online device. {QR-Code is generated}
#####  Offline: 
Unlock wallet with offline device.
Scan QR-Code, which is displayed on online device.
Sign transaction offline. {QR-Code is generated, this is the RAW transaction}
#####  Online:  
Scan QR-Code, which is displayed on offline device.
Review transaction, check, if all is displayed as expected.
Confirm and Send Raw transaction to Network.

Be careful, what you do. I'm not responsible for any damage. Practice with some small amounts.

### Special Thanks

Without her, this wallet would not exist. You can find her [here](https://www.michellewhitedove.com).
