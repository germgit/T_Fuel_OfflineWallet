  Theta T-Fuel Offline Wallet
*=============================*

Description
  This wallet allows you to sign and send transactions into the Theta Network, while your private key remains offline.
  The wallet has two parts, one is online and the other is offline.
  Inside the online part you define a transaction, while the offline version does the transaction signing with the private key.
  Quick information exchange between online- and offline- device is done by QR-Codes or file exchange (e.g. SD-Card).
